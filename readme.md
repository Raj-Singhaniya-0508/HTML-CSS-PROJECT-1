# HTML-CSS-PROJECT-01

This project explores the use of the Flex property and Z-index in HTML/CSS.

# Description

In this project, I have learnt the Flex property, which is a powerful tool in CSS. With the Flex property, I was able to easily manipulate the arrangement of elements within a container, adjusting their size, alignment, and order as needed.

Additionally, I explored the Z-index property, which controls the stacking order of elements on the z-axis (depth) when they overlap. By strategically setting the Z-index values, I could control which elements appear in front of others, creating layered designs and controlling the visual hierarchy of my webpage.
